Computer Vision:
Field of AI---> that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world

has been around 1950's eg: barcode reader

car is able to drive - CV
easiest technology to implement
Tasks based on vision:
- traffice inspectors
- MRI scan analysis experts
- Sports Umpires
- Equipment Inspections
All the above tasks can be automated
Businesses can:
increase efficiency, save costs
Human workers can do more tasks

How computer vision works:

There are basically 2 types of CV:
1. Classical - relies on pre-built libraries of features
eg: for instance if we have to detect a face, the pre-determined libraries detects very quickly eyes,nose, mouth and so on
- No neural networks are involved
- classical CV is:
   - Efficient
   - Extremely fast
Classical Algorithm Works best for common objects and works with accuracy
2. Deep Learning -  types of neural networks that make possible Deep Learning for Computer Vision are Convolutional Neural Networks
- consider a black box inside which there's a neural network - learns without pre-programming
        - Has a capacity for memory and experience
we will feed the black box tens of thousands of images of say cats/dogs
- overtime the NN will have seen enough images of both animals to extract distinct features
CNN can be taught to identify any type of object.


Tomato sorting using CV:
consider 3 ppl looking for good and rotten/unripe tomatoes on a conveyor belt
problems:
human error, slower, boring task for the ppl, pay wages for the ppl

how we use CV here:
using the deep learning algorithm we show a lot of good and bad tomatoes.
So you have the labeled data. You put camera on top of the ppl who are working so that it will see tomatoes through and those images will be classified as good to go.

advantages:
cost is minimized
errors are minimized
speed is maximized
No days off (sick days)
More meaningful creative and enjoyable work


Applications of Computer Vision:
all can be implied to images and videos(multiple frames)
1. image classification (is this image of cat/dog)
2. Image segmentation - partitions images into multiple regions or pieces to be examined seperately(how skype can blur the background behind user)
3. Object detection -(is there pedestrian or not)
4. Object tracking - (where is pedestrian going)
5. Image generation - (generate 3d representation with 2d images)
6. Edge detection - outside edges of object and say what is in image
7. face detection
8. facial recognition - identify specific individuals
9. Optical character detection -hand written docs
10. Pattern detection - recognizes shapes and all
11. Feature detection - matches similarities and group under a single thing.
